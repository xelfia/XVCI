# XVCI
* X.VCI: A bit experimental runtime for VCI

# What?

Note that almost VCI features are not implemented on this.
This is only implemented based on official and/or third-party VCI documents.

> VirtualCast is a practical VCI enviromnent I know.
> I have no VR devices currently (2019-03-01), although VitualCast required it.
> So I have no experiences about VirtualCast and actual VCI behaviors.
