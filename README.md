# XVCI
* X.VCI: A bit experimental runtime for VCI
  * As toolkits (projects), `VCI` and `XVCI` are available on `Unity`
  * XVCI tested with `Unity 2018.3.6f1`

# What is XVCI
* Note that almost VCI features are not implemented on this.
* This is only implemented based on official and/or third-party VCI documents.

> * VirtualCast is a practical VCI enviromnent I know.
> * I have no VR devices currently `2019-03-01`, although VitualCast requires it.
> * So I have no experiences about VirtualCast and actual VCI behaviors.
